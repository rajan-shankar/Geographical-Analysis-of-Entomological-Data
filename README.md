# Geographical-Analysis-of-Entomological-Data

A report providing key insights into the geographical origins of Dr Philp's real entomological collection. This was one of the group projects I undertook in my DATA1901 unit.

The .html file is the final product. The four .csv/.xlsx files are required to compile the .Rmd file. ProvenanceOfEntomology is Dr Philp's raw data file, while locationData and taxonomyData were provided to us to aid our analysis. BingConvertedData was produced during our project since our analysis centred around countries of origin, so reverse geocoding using the Bing Maps API was required.
